Using these modded xml files / snippets could break the functioning of your DAYZ server, requiring a reinstall that would wipe
all player progress.

Using these modded xml files / snippets neccessitates increased regular restarts to prevent server crashing.

It is suggested you thoroughly test your server after applying these files / snippets to ensure proper
functioning of your server.

To install these files simply copy them into the relevant parts of the described XML files and restart your server.

These XML Sniipets will add an "Admin Event Truck" to your server - allowing you to spawn in large quantities of items
and transport them easily.

The "event truck" spawns in at the top of the Ski Run in the West,
and the idea behind it is that it is a "spare" truck that you can load up with whatever you like (edit its entry in cfgspawnabletypes),
and it won't appear anywhere else. I wanted a truck that I could fill with weapons, or NVG, or Hesco crates, or barrels, or tents  etc,
that could be used to "create" events elsewhere in the map eg laying out a race track at NWAF, or putting tents down for a Conquest type
PvP event etc - in otherwords a simple way a server owner can easily spawn in a lot of items and them have the ability to drive them somewhere. DONE.

The Event Truck is a one-off spawn. To make it spawn in again, either "ruin" the engines or disable and re-enable the
event. Do this if you want to reload it in with defferent items.

Thankyou!
